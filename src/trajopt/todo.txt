Make collision checker able to remove objects

Write function to check trajectory safety

More validation on initialization

Don't allow non-robot kinbodies to collide

Partition links into groups and do broadphase filtering

use userdata in collision checker

make optimization parameters settable

bug when using "active" as manip

occasionally get infeasible relaxed problem. why?
probably because the initialization is bad. should make the first step
of the optimization satisfy the linear constraints

openrave initfromtrimesh bug

velocity cost uses timestamps
